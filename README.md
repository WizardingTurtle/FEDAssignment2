# FEDAssignment2

Our project is focused on making a quiz wesbite with the purpose of entertaining users and testing their trivia knowledge.

## Design Process

Website is designed for all age groups but is mostly focused on the young adult audience (aged 16 to 30)

We want them to use the website as a way to pass the time and maybe even learn something

Thus we decided on a quiz website to challenge user's knowledge on certain topics.

Currently we plan on a fast paced quiz experience to keep the users on their toes.

# User Experience

Users will create an account to login and keep track of their score (guest function to be planned)
They will then see the homepage of the website where they can see the quizzes they want to try and scroll down for more
Upon clicking on a quiz they will have a brief moment to read the title and description of the quiz before jumping straight into timed question sections
Each question answered correctly improves their score and time while failing to do so worsens their score and reduces time they have to complete the quiz
Upon completing a quiz they will get points added to their account based on their performance on the quiz (repeating quizes does not stack points)
Users can then look at the leaderboards to see how they fare against other users
